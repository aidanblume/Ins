Title:              step4_procedures
Description:        Associates cases with procedures in a relationship table.
                    Associates cases with surgery in a relationship table. 
Version Control:    https://dsghe.lacare.org/nblume/Readmissions/tree/master/Code/Data_Acquisition_and_Understanding/Cloudera%20DSW/Iteration2/
Data Source:        swat.claims_universe and HOAP.HOA QNXT, CLM and ENC case tables. 
Input:              NATHALIE.prjrea_step3_diagnoses
Output:             NATHALIE.prjrea_case_proc (includes newly engineered fields, e.g. surgery)
                    NATHALIE.prjrea_step4_procedures
Notes:              1. Inpatient cases are identified with 'where srv_cat = '01ip_a' on the sace files. 
                    This excludes more SNF inpatient stays than using substr(type_bill,1,2) in ('11','12') on the hdr files.
                    2. Unique tupple (cin_no, admi_dt) are selected with priority (1) later disc_dt, and (2) QNXT>CLM>ENC ** Note that this departs from the SAS script received in 2017
