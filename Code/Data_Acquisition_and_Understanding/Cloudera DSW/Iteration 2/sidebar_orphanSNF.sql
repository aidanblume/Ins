/*
-- Separate SNFs that must follow this rul from LTCs that don't (what about LTACs? subacutes?)

-- Exclude CCI segmenta nd DHS site so that you have more accurate info

-- Rule 1: IP is at least 3 nights

-- Rule 2: SNF starts within 30 days of discharge

-- Rule 2 addendum: If there are intervening stays (incl. LTAC, subacute) then the 30 day rule is relaxed accordingsly

-- If still left with significant number of direct-to-SNF:
-Eg look at number & type of services offered during these 'direct to snf' stays? H: there are fewer services, esp. in first few days, which explains why I dropped from 12% when I looked at claims following IP within 3d to 10% when I looked at cases following IP within 3d
-Qualifications of attending staff? LTC should never be licensed nurse or medical doctor?
-LOS for direct SNF should be longer than for IP-to_SNF stays if they are in fact LTC stays
-Direct SNF stays should hap
