The Rothman brothers built a morbidity index after the preventable death of their mother. The index has a very high AUROC, predicts readmission as well as mortality, has been implemented at several east coast facilities, and makes heavy use of nursing notes. It may be most useful to heart failure cases but it is being applied more broadly.

I have the relevant peer-reviewed literature by the Rothmans as well as by independent researchers at centers where the Rothman Indexwas implemented. There’s info there that I am already using to develop an LA Care model.
