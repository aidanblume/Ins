A group in Dallas has been successful at reducing readmissions. Their efforts include generating a predictive model through machine learning, improving data input through a regional data sharing network, and successfully inserting their output into clinician dashboards.

A physician-led group at Parkland Health & hospital System, Dallas developed, using machine learning, a model to predict readmissions and mortality in real time. Their eModel then became a part of a broader initiative to make the model useful in real time and on the ground at hospitals in Dallas and elsewhere. This broader initiative included PIECES and the Dallas Information Exchange Portal (Dallas IEP) where a single patient’s info could be tracked across providers, and not just medical providers but also social support providers.

Media highlights:  “The Center for Clinical Innovations at Parkland received grants from several sources, including the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health to support its work on the model, which combines 29 data points extracted from its EMR. The data includes physiologic, laboratory, demographic, and utilization variables that can be pulled from a patient's EMR within 24 hours of hospital admission. The comprehensive algorithm has proven to be accurate at predicting readmission or death, says Ruben Amarasingham, MD, director of Parkland's center for clinical innovation and assistant professor of medicine at UT Southwestern. Preliminary results show 33% reductions in readmission of Medicare heart failure patients and 20% reduction in readmissions for all HF patients (source: http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/finance/how-predictive-modeling-cuts-hospital-readmissions).”

I have the relevant peer-reviewed literature by Dr. Amarasingham as well as by independent researchers at centers where the eModel was implemented. There’s info there that I am already using to develop an LA Care model. 

This Dallas group may serve as a great model for a provider-level implementation of readmission predictive models.
