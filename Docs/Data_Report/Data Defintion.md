# Data and Feature Definitions

This document provides a central hub for the raw data sources, the processed/transformed data, and feature sets. More details of each dataset is provided in their respective Data Summary Reports. 

For each data, an individual report describing the data schema, the meaning of each data field, and other information that is helpful for understanding the data is provided. If the dataset is the output of processing/transforming/feature engineering existing data set(s), the names of the input data sets, and the links to scripts that are used to conduct the operation are also provided. 

For each dataset, the links to the sample datasets in the _**Data**_ directory are also provided. 

_**For ease of modifying this report, placeholder links are included in this page, for example a link to dataset 1, but they are just placeholders pointing to a non-existent page. These should be modified to point to the actual location.**_
