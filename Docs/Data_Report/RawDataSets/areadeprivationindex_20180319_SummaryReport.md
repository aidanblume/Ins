# Data Report

## General summary of the data
Area Deprivation scores are sourced from [https://www.hipxchange.org/ADI](https://www.hipxchange.org/ADI). The Area Deprivation Index dataset was built by researchers and clinicians in the [Health Innovation Program](https://hip.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine & Public Health, using the index developed by Gopal Singh, PhD, MS, MSc. The mission of the Health Innovation Program is to improve health care delivery and population health across the State of Wisconsin and the nation through conducting and disseminating health services research that partners UW faculty with Wisconsin healthcare organizations.

The area deprivation index represents a geographic area-based measure of the socioeconomic deprivation experienced by a neighborhood.  Higher index values represent higher levels of deprivation. Higher levels of deprivation have been associated with an increased risk of adverse health and health care outcomes. The original index developed by Gopal Singh, PhD, MS, MSc used 17 different markers of socioeconomic status from the 1990 Census data. HIP has generated an updated index using 2000 census block group-level data and the original Singh coefficients from the 1990 data.  The index includes the following variables:

Percent of the population aged 25 and older with less than 9 years of education
Percent of the population aged 25 and older with at least a high school diploma
Percent employed persons aged 16 and older in white-collar occupations
Median family income in US dollars
Income disparity
Median home value in US dollars
Median gross rent in US dollars
Median monthly mortgage in US dollars
Percent of owner-occupied housing units
Percent of civilian labor force population aged 16 years and older who are unemployed
Percent of families below federal poverty level
Percent of the population below 150% of the federal poverty threshold
Percent of single-parent households with children less than 18 years of age
Percent of households without a motor vehicle
Percent of households without a telephone
Percent of occupied housing units without complete plumbing
Percent of households with more than 1 person per room

## Data quality summary

## Target variable
readmission (not in this data set)

## Individual variables
Datasets with Area Deprviation Index scores for a variety of U.S. Census data levels:
9-digit zip codes (available in one large dataset or smaller state-specific datasets)
U.S. Census block group codes 

## Variable ranking

## Relationship between explanatory variables and target variable
PARR-30, a U.K. model predicting readmission, succesfully uses a similar index. The ADI may be a proxi for health, economic stress, access to quality healthcare, and healthcare utilization patterns. These predict readmission.
