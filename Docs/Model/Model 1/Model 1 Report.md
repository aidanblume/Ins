# Model 1 Report

_A report to provide details on a specific experiment (model) - possibly one of many._


## Analytic Approach
* What is target definition?
* What are inputs (description)?
* What kind of model was built?

## Model Description

* Models and Parameters

	* Description or images of data flow graph
	* What learner(s) were used?
	* Learner hyper-parameters?


## Results (Model Performance)
* ROC/Lift charts, AUC, R^2, MAPE as appropriate
* Performance graphs for parameters sweeps if applicable

## Model Understanding

* Variable Importance (significance)

* Insight Derived from the Model



## Conclusion and Discussions for Next Steps

* Conclusion on Feasibility Assessment of the Machine Learning Task

* Discussion on Overfitting (If Applicable)

* What other features can be generated from the current data?

* What other relevant data source are available to potentially help the modeling?
