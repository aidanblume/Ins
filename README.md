 # L.A. Care Data Science Innovation 
 # Readmissions Project

Readmission within 30 days of an inpatient discharge is a CMS focus and affects provider reimbursement. Identifying members at risk of readmission is the first step toward goal that include anticipating the cost of readmissions over a given time period, identifying systemic factors that contribute to preventable readmissions (e.g. a PGP with subpar systems for inter-shift communication), and flagging individual members for differentiated care based on their readmission risk (e.g. intensive case management for highest-risk members, action on member-specific contributing factors). The benefits of this project may include cost-savings, service to (--> goodwill from) PGPs, and better individualized care for members.

**Main Project:**

*Initiation:*  Use Case Study referenced by [insert unique ID?] initiated 20171215 by Dino / Dr. Miller. 

*Goal:*  Generate binary prediction of whether or not a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of an inpatient discharge. 

*To do:*  Write Charter. See road map [need to specify location] for details. 

**Associated Project A:**

*Initiation:*  Use Case Study referenced by [insert unique ID?] initiated 20180117 by Mark Ishimatsu. 

*Goal:*  Generate binary prediction from in-home well-visits plus other EHR data of whether or not a patient who has received a well-visit from a mobile adjunct provider will be [needs to be defined: admitted as an inpatient within X time period]. 

*To do:*  Obtain member list, well-visit form and location of resulting EHR data. Explore. 

**Associated Project B:**

*Initiation:*  Unclear whether is initiated. If it is, then initiated by Miguel Barcenas. 

*Goal:*  Generate binary prediction for 180,000 patients under DHS billing and admitted to an inpatient unit. 

*To do:*  Initial meeting with Miguel Barcenas. 

**Associated Project C:**

*Initiation:*  Unclear whether is initiated. If it is, then initiated by Chriss Wheeler. 

*Goal:*  Generate gradient of risk scores for candidates for care management. 

*To do:*  Follow-up with Brandon Shelton.

**NOTE:** In this directory structure, the **Sample_Data folder is NOT supposed to contain LARGE raw or processed data**. It is only supposed to contain **small and sample** data sets, which could be used to test the code.

The two documents under Docs/Project, namely the [Charter](./Docs/Project/Charter.md) and [Exit Report](./Docs/Project/Exit%20Report.md) are particularly important to consider. They help to define the project at the start of an engagement, and provide a final report to the customer or client.

**NOTE:** In some projects, e.g. short term Proof of Concept (PoC) or Proof of Value (PoV) engagements, it can be relatively time consuming to create and all the recommended documents and artifacts. In that case, at least the Charter and Exit Report should be created and delivered to the customer or client. As necessary, organizations may modify certain sections of the documents. But it is strongly recommended that the content of the documents be maintained, as they provide important information about the project and deliverables.
